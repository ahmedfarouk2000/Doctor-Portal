# Project Title

The goal of this product is to give our doctors an easy way to manage appointments within their clinics and maintain their patients’ histories.
The portal should have 2 different user privileges, one for the doctor & another for his assistant. 
The assistant should be able to do the below actions:
-	View the Doctor’s Schedule 
-	Reserve / cancel patient appointments 
-	Enter / Update the patient data before the appointment 
-	Enter / update the patient’s EMR before the appointment (Patient Vitals / Medical Tests & Scans)
